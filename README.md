Installation* (not yet a real cocoapod) 
------------

    pod 'FCWebicons'


Usage
-----


This will install icons to your app under `resources/webicons`

The usage of SVGKit in views is an exercise for the reader (examples welcome).

Requirements
------------

* iOS: SVGKit pod (included)

* Mac: TODO... SVGKit probably needs some love


License
-------

CC-Attrib, same as the icons.
